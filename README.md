# OPDs

The Orioneum Protocol Descriptions (OPDs) provide a description of the protocol specifications, client APIs and SDKs, and asset standards.

# Contributing

Anyone can contribute to the Orioneum Protocol. The following steps highlights the process:  
1. Fork this repository.
2. Collaborate and draft an OPD proposal in your repository.
3. Submit a Merge Request to have your fork merged into this repository.
4. Collaborate with Orioneum maintainers to reach *final* status.

Before starting, read the [OPD Template](https://gitlab.com/orioneum/opds/blob/master/OPDs/opd0.md), and review [OPD1](https://gitlab.com/orioneum/opds/blob/master/OPDs/opd1.md). Provide as much information as possible along with contact information for further discussion. When ready for submission, submit the Merge Request and one of the Orioneum maintainers will come back to you.  

An OPD can describe different types, but they are mainly categorized into the following:

### Protocol
This type is for changes in the protocol itself.

### Standards
This type is for asset definitions. In the Orioneum ecosystem, these are called Orioneum Asset Definitions (OADs) and are the standards for what nature of the asset that is registered onto Orioneum.

# ODP status stages

> **Draft** A proposal for a new description  
> **Update** An update to the description itself (with change in mainstream code)  
> **Final** A finalized description (with an implementation merged into mainstream code)
